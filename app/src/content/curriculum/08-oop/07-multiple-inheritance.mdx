# Multiple Inheritance

<OOPVisualizer initialMode="inheritance" />

Python goes beyond most OOP languages (like Java) by allowing **Multiple Inheritance**. This means a single child class can inherit from *more than one* parent class simultaneously.

While powerful, it must be used carefully to avoid highly complex, confusing code architectures. A common and safe use case for multiple inheritance is using **Mixins**—small classes that provide a specific feature to be "mixed in" to other classes.

## Basic Syntax

To inherit from multiple parents, simply list them separated by commas in the class definition.

<interactive-code>
class Flyer:
    def fly(self):
        return "I am flying!"

class Swimmer:
    def swim(self):
        return "I am swimming!"

# Duck inherits from BOTH Flyer and Swimmer
class Duck(Flyer, Swimmer):
    def quack(self):
        return "Quack!"

donald = Duck()
print(donald.quack())
print(donald.fly())      # Inherited from Flyer
print(donald.swim())     # Inherited from Swimmer
</interactive-code>

## Multi-Class Diagram

In a multi-inheritance diagram, the child class has arrows pointing to multiple distinct superclasses.

    class Flyer {
      +fly()
    }
    class Swimmer {
      +swim()
    }
    class Duck {
      +quack()
    }
    
    Flyer <|-- Duck
    Swimmer <|-- Duck
`} />

## The Diamond Problem and MRO (Method Resolution Order)

What if you inherit from two classes, and they *both* have a method with the exact same name? Which one does Python call?

This is known as the "Diamond Problem." Python solves this politely using **MRO (Method Resolution Order)**. It follows a specific algorithm (called C3 Linearization) to decide the search order for methods. Generally, it searches from Left to Right through the parent classes specified.

<interactive-code>
class A:
    def speak(self):
        return "A speaks"

class B(A):
    def speak(self):
        return "B speaks"

class C(A):
    def speak(self):
        return "C speaks"

# D inherits from B first, then C. 
class D(B, C):
    pass

my_d = D()

# Let's see who wins!
print(my_d.speak())

# You can always view the exact search order using the .__mro__ attribute
print(D.__mro__)
</interactive-code>

In the code above, `D` searches `B` first because it was listed first `class D(B, C)`. If `B` didn't have the method, it would then check `C`, and finally `A`.
