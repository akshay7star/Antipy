# Operators: How Python Does Math & Logic

Every program needs to compute, compare, and decide. Python provides three families of operators to handle this. Think of operators as the **verbs** of programming — they tell Python what to *do* with your data.

<OperatorsVisualizer />

## Arithmetic Operators

These are your basic math tools. They work on numbers (`int` and `float`).

| Operator | Name | Example | Result |
|----------|------|---------|--------|
| `+` | Addition | `10 + 3` | `13` |
| `-` | Subtraction | `10 - 3` | `7` |
| `*` | Multiplication | `10 * 3` | `30` |
| `/` | Division | `10 / 3` | `3.333...` |
| `//` | Floor Division | `10 // 3` | `3` |
| `%` | Modulo (remainder) | `10 % 3` | `1` |
| `**` | Exponentiation | `2 ** 10` | `1024` |

<MethodUnit category="operators" />

### The Division Trap

Python has **two** division operators, and confusing them is a common source of bugs:

```python
10 / 3    # 3.3333... — true division, ALWAYS returns float
10 // 3   # 3         — floor division, rounds DOWN to integer
-10 // 3  # -4        — rounds toward NEGATIVE infinity, not zero!
```

### The Modulo Operator `%`

Modulo gives you the **remainder** after division. It's more useful than it sounds:

```python
15 % 4    # 3  (15 ÷ 4 = 3 remainder 3)
10 % 2    # 0  (10 ÷ 2 = 5 remainder 0 — it's even!)
7 % 2     # 1  (7 ÷ 2 = 3 remainder 1 — it's odd!)
```

**Real-world uses:**
- Check if even/odd: `num % 2 == 0`
- Wrap around (clock math): `hour % 12`
- Every Nth item: `if index % 5 == 0`

### Practice: Calculator

<interactive-code>
a = 17
b = 5

print(f"{a} + {b} = {a + b}")
print(f"{a} - {b} = {a - b}")
print(f"{a} * {b} = {a * b}")
print(f"{a} / {b} = {a / b}")        # True division
print(f"{a} // {b} = {a // b}")      # Floor division
print(f"{a} % {b} = {a % b}")        # Remainder
print(f"{a} ** {b} = {a ** b}")      # 17 to the power of 5

# Practical: Is 'a' even or odd?
if a % 2 == 0:
    print(f"\n{a} is EVEN")
else:
    print(f"\n{a} is ODD")
</interactive-code>

## Comparison Operators

These compare two values and return `True` or `False`. They're the foundation of every `if` statement and loop condition.

| Operator | Meaning | Example | Result |
|----------|---------|---------|--------|
| `==` | Equal to | `5 == 5` | `True` |
| `!=` | Not equal to | `5 != 3` | `True` |
| `>` | Greater than | `5 > 3` | `True` |
| `<` | Less than | `5 < 3` | `False` |
| `>=` | Greater or equal | `5 >= 5` | `True` |
| `<=` | Less or equal | `5 <= 3` | `False` |

### Chained Comparisons

Python lets you chain comparisons — this is rare in other languages and very readable:

```python
# Instead of: x > 0 and x < 100
x = 50
print(0 < x < 100)    # True — x is between 0 and 100
print(1 <= x <= 10)    # False — x is not between 1 and 10
```

## Boolean Logic

<MethodUnit category="boolean-operations" />

Boolean operators combine True/False values. Think of them like an electrical circuit:

<MermaidDiagram>
graph LR
  A["Condition A"] --> AND{"and"}
  B["Condition B"] --> AND
  AND --> R1["True only if BOTH are True"]
  A2["Condition A"] --> OR{"or"}
  B2["Condition B"] --> OR
  OR --> R2["True if EITHER is True"]
  C["Condition"] --> NOT{"not"}
  NOT --> R3["Flips True to False"]

  style OR fill:#22c55e,stroke:#16a34a,color:#fff
  style NOT fill:#ef4444,stroke:#dc2626,color:#fff
</MermaidDiagram>

### Truth Table

| A | B | `A and B` | `A or B` | `not A` |
|------|------|-----------|----------|---------|
| True | True | True | True | False |
| True | False | False | True | False |
| False | True | False | True | True |
| False | False | False | False | True |

### Practice: Logical Combinations

<interactive-code>
# Real-world example: Password validator
password = "MyP@ss123"

has_upper = any(c.isupper() for c in password)
has_digit = any(c.isdigit() for c in password)
long_enough = len(password) >= 8

print(f"Password: '{password}'")
print(f"  Has uppercase: {has_upper}")
print(f"  Has digit: {has_digit}")
print(f"  Long enough: {long_enough}")

if has_upper and has_digit and long_enough:
    print("  Result: Strong password!")
elif has_upper or has_digit:
    print("  Result: Moderate — add more complexity")
else:
    print("  Result: Weak password!")
</interactive-code>

## Operator Precedence

Just like in math, Python evaluates operators in a specific order. When in doubt, use **parentheses** to make it explicit:

```python
# Without parentheses — confusing
result = 2 + 3 * 4    # 14, not 20 (multiplication first)

# With parentheses — clear
result = (2 + 3) * 4  # 20
```

**Order (highest → lowest):** `**` → `*` `/` `//` `%` → `+` `-` → `==` `!=` `>` `<` → `not` → `and` → `or`

### Practice: Precedence Puzzle

<interactive-code>
# What does each line evaluate to? Predict, then check!
print(2 + 3 * 4)         # ? (hint: multiplication first)
print((2 + 3) * 4)       # ? (hint: parentheses first)
print(10 - 2 ** 3)       # ? (hint: exponent first)
print(True or False and False)  # ? (hint: 'and' before 'or')
print((True or False) and False) # ? (parentheses change it!)
</interactive-code>

> **Pro Tip:** When combining `and`/`or` in complex conditions, always use parentheses even if they're technically not required. `(a > 5) and (b < 10)` is much clearer than `a > 5 and b < 10`.

> **Common Mistake:** Using `=` (assignment) instead of `==` (comparison) in conditions. `if x = 5` is a syntax error. You want `if x == 5`.

<InlineQuiz id="quiz-ops-2" question="What does 7 % 3 return?" options={["2", "1", "2.33", "0"]} correct={1} explanation="% is the modulo operator � it returns the REMAINDER of division. 7 divided by 3 is 2 remainder 1." />

<InlineQuiz id="quiz-ops-3" question="What does 2 ** 10 evaluate to?" options={["20", "100", "1024", "210"]} correct={2} explanation="** is the exponentiation operator. 2 ** 10 means 2 to the power of 10, which is 1024." />

<InlineQuiz id="quiz-ops-4" question="What is the difference between = and ==?" options={["No difference", "= assigns, == compares", "= compares, == assigns", "Both compare values"]} correct={1} explanation="= is the assignment operator (x = 5). == is the equality comparison operator (x == 5 returns True or False)." />

<InlineQuiz id="quiz-ops-5" question="What does 'hello' * 3 produce?" options={["Error", "hellohellohello", "hello 3", "hello*3"]} correct={1} explanation="The * operator with strings repeats them. 'hello' * 3 produces 'hellohellohello'." />

<InlineQuiz id="quiz-ops-6" question="What is the result of: 5 > 3 and 2 < 1?" options={["True", "False", "Error", "None"]} correct={1} explanation="5 > 3 is True, but 2 < 1 is False. True and False = False. Both conditions must be True for 'and' to return True." />

<InlineQuiz id="quiz-ops-7" question="What does += do?" options={["Checks equality", "Adds and assigns (x += 1 is x = x + 1)", "Increments by 2", "Concatenates only"]} correct={1} explanation="x += 1 is shorthand for x = x + 1. It's an augmented assignment operator. Also works with strings: s += 'text'." />

<InlineQuiz id="quiz-ops-8" question="What is operator precedence?" options={["The order operators were added to Python", "The order Python evaluates operators in an expression", "How fast operators execute", "The number of operands"]} correct={1} explanation="Operator precedence determines the order of evaluation. For example, * has higher precedence than +, so 2 + 3 * 4 = 14, not 20." />

<InlineQuiz id="quiz-ops-9" question="What does the 'in' operator do?" options={["Checks if a value exists in a collection", "Imports a module", "Creates a loop", "Assigns a value"]} correct={0} explanation="'in' checks membership: '5 in [1,2,5]' returns True. Works with lists, tuples, sets, dict keys, and substrings." />

<InlineQuiz id="quiz-ops-10" question="What is the result of: not (True or False)?" options={["True", "False", "None", "Error"]} correct={1} explanation="True or False = True. Then not True = False. Parentheses around 'or' ensure it evaluates first." />
