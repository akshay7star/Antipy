# Loops: The Power of Repetition

If you had to print "Hello" 1000 times, you wouldn't write 1000 `print()` statements. Loops let you repeat a block of code as many times as you need. They're the core of automation — bulk processing files, analyzing datasets, handling user requests, and everything in between.

## Two Types of Loops

Python has exactly two loop types. The choice between them is simple:

<MermaidDiagram>

  Q{"Do you know how many times to repeat?"} -- Yes --> FOR["Use for loop"]
  Q -- No --> WHILE["Use while loop"]
  FOR --> Ex1["Loop over a list, range, or string"]
  WHILE --> Ex2["Keep going until a condition changes"]

  style WHILE fill:#f59e0b,stroke:#d97706,color:#000
</MermaidDiagram>

## The `for` Loop

A `for` loop goes through each item in a **sequence** (list, string, range, etc.) one at a time. It automatically stops when it runs out of items.

```python
# Loop over a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
# Prints: apple, banana, cherry (one per line)
```

The variable `fruit` is called the **loop variable**. On each pass (called an "iteration"), it takes on the next value from the list.

### `range()` — Looping a Specific Number of Times

`range()` generates a sequence of numbers. It's the most common way to loop a fixed number of times:

```python
range(5)         # → 0, 1, 2, 3, 4           (start=0, stop=5)
range(2, 7)      # → 2, 3, 4, 5, 6           (start=2, stop=7)
range(0, 10, 2)  # → 0, 2, 4, 6, 8           (start=0, stop=10, step=2)
range(10, 0, -1) # → 10, 9, 8, ..., 2, 1     (countdown!)
```

Notice: `range(5)` gives you 0 through 4 — it **never includes the stop value**. This matches how list indexing works (lists start at index 0).

### Practice: For Loops

<interactive-code>
# Basic counting
print("Counting to 5:")
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(f"  {i}")

# Loop over characters in a string
word = "Python"
print(f"\nLetters in '{word}':")
for letter in word:
    print(f"  {letter}")

# Use range with step
print("\nEven numbers under 20:")
for n in range(0, 20, 2):
    print(n, end=" ")
</interactive-code>

## The `while` Loop

A `while` loop keeps repeating **as long as its condition is True**. It checks the condition before each iteration.

```python
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1     # Without this, the loop runs FOREVER!
```

**Warning:** If the condition never becomes `False`, you get an **infinite loop** that freezes your program. Always make sure something inside the loop eventually changes the condition.

### Practice: While Loop

<interactive-code>
# Countdown
countdown = 5
while countdown > 0:
    print(f"T-minus {countdown}...")
    countdown -= 1
print("Liftoff!")

# Find the first power of 2 above 1000
power = 1
while power <= 1000:
    power *= 2
print(f"\nFirst power of 2 above 1000: {power}")
</interactive-code>

## Loop Control: `break` and `continue`

Sometimes you need to exit a loop early or skip certain iterations:

- **`break`** — immediately exits the entire loop
- **`continue`** — skips the rest of the current iteration and jumps to the next one

<MermaidDiagram>

  LOOP["Loop iteration"] --> CHECK{"Check condition"}

  SKIP --> LOOP
  style EXIT fill:#ef4444,stroke:#dc2626,color:#fff
  style SKIP fill:#f59e0b,stroke:#d97706,color:#000
</MermaidDiagram>

### Practice: Break and Continue

<interactive-code>
# break — stop searching once found
numbers = [4, 7, 2, 9, 1, 8, 3]
target = 9

for num in numbers:
    if num == target:
        print(f"Found {target}!")
        break
    print(f"  Checking {num}... not it")

# continue — skip odd numbers
print("\nEven numbers only:")
for i in range(10):
    if i % 2 != 0:
        continue  # Skip odd numbers
    print(i, end=" ")
</interactive-code>

## Nested Loops

A loop inside another loop. The inner loop runs completely for **each** iteration of the outer loop.

### Practice: Multiplication Table

<interactive-code>
# Build a multiplication table
size = 5
for row in range(1, size + 1):
    for col in range(1, size + 1):
        print(f"{row * col:4}", end="")
    print()  # New line after each row
</interactive-code>

> **Pro Tip:** If you need both the index AND the value, use `enumerate()` instead of `range(len(...))`: `for i, val in enumerate(my_list):`.

> **Common Mistake:** Modifying a list while looping over it. This causes skipped items or crashes. Instead, loop over a copy: `for item in my_list.copy():`.

<InlineQuiz id="quiz-loops-1" question="How many times does 'for i in range(5):' loop?" options={["4 times", "5 times", "6 times", "It depends"]} correct={1} explanation="range(5) produces [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] � exactly 5 values, so the loop runs 5 times." />

<InlineQuiz id="quiz-loops-4" question="What does 'continue' do in a loop?" options={["Stops the loop", "Skips to the next iteration", "Continues to the next function", "Restarts the loop from the beginning"]} correct={1} explanation="'continue' skips the rest of the current iteration and goes to the next one. The loop continues running." />

<InlineQuiz id="quiz-loops-5" question="What is an infinite loop?" options={["A loop that runs exactly 1000 times", "A loop whose condition never becomes False", "A loop without a body", "A nested loop"]} correct={1} explanation="An infinite loop runs forever because its condition never becomes False. Example: while True: ... You must use 'break' to exit." />

<InlineQuiz id="quiz-loops-6" question="What does range(0, 10, 2) produce?" options={["[0, 2, 4, 6, 8]", "[0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]", "[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]", "[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]"]} correct={0} explanation="range(start, stop, step) generates values from 0 to 9 in steps of 2: [0, 2, 4, 6, 8].

<InlineQuiz id="quiz-loops-8" question="What is the 'else' clause on a for loop?" options={["Runs if the loop body has an error", "Runs if the loop completes without hitting break", "Runs on each iteration", "It does not exist in Python"]} correct={1} explanation="A for/else clause runs the else block only if the loop completes normally (without break). If break is called, the else block is skipped." />

<InlineQuiz id="quiz-loops-9" question="How do you iterate over both index and value in a list?" options={["for i, v in list:", "for i in range(len(list)): v = list[i]", "for i, v in enumerate(list):", "Both B and C work, but C is preferred"]} correct={3} explanation="Both approaches work, but enumerate() is the Pythonic way. It gives you (index, value) tuples directly." />

<InlineQuiz id="quiz-loops-10" question="What is the output of: for i in range(3): print(i, end=' ')?" options={["1 2 3", "0 1 2", "0 1 2 3", "1 2"]} correct={1} explanation="range(3) gives [0, 1, 2]. The end=' ' makes print use a space instead of newline. Output: '0 1 2 '." />
